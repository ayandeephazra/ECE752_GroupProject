    The calcparams  function is assigning history table lengths accordingly. But the number of history tables have been specified earlier.

    buildTageTables function is creating the tables with the TAGEEntry struct according to the size calculated from above.size

    The number of history lengths was fixed at 16. The size of each history length is, obviously, geometric. But a table will be assigned to a history length only on determining that it is useful to do so.
    
    There is a configuration vector that tells you how many tiles (and hence entries) are present for a particular history length. Thus, here, the config vector will have 16 entries.

    The number of Tage Entries for a table of a particular history length will be determined by the logTagTableSizes std::vector. That is initialized from TAGEBaseParams

    According to the longest history, the tag size has to be determined.
